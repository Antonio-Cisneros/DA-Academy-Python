I used Jupyter Notebook. The python version installed was 3.9.6 

## Jupyter installation

Execute the following 2 commands

```bash
$ python -m pip install wheel
```

```bash
$ python -m pip install jupyter
```

To initialize or run Jupyter notebook just write the following command

```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```
